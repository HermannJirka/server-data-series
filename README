## I worked out the project according to the assignment
### Statistics endpoints
Average - Buckets are formed after 15 minutes, if bucket doesn´t have any records average of the value is zero
But there are some options:
1. insert a null value instead of a zero
2. bring up this bucket

Moving average is calculated from the average values, if bucket doesn´t have any records average of the value is zero
But there are some options:
1. insert a null value instead of a zero
2. bring up this bucket

These options depend on the assignment of the rest api
